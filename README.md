Memecoin is a digital currency that is built upon the Litecoin sourcecode. The purpose of Memecoin is provide versatility and longevity to the meme economy. Memes are temporary and tend to die out quickly. Memecoin is supposed to be a generalized cryptocurrency that automatically adapts according to the relative memes out on the market. This project was built upon the idea of providing new users to enter the cryptocurrency space with restarting the difficulty algorithm, since most cryptocurrency's difficulty have skyrocketed almost making it impossible for new users to enter the space. A majority of cryptocurrencies are held by a small group, due to them entering the space early.

I wanted to allow people of all demographics to be introduced to mining without much technical experience. All mining procedures will be simply done through the Memecoin digital wallet. The wallet will serve as a hub to hold your MEME balance, track past and current transactions, see how many users are on the network, and to start mining with a simple command.

Specifications of how to run the wallet and mine will be displayed later once I have launched the block explorer to the web, and compiled a Windows based wallet. The current wallet is compatible with Linux based systems.

I want to thank the Bitcoin and Litecoin developers for developing and maturing the cryptocurrency space.
